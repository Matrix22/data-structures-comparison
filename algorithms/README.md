Algorithms to represent a set of numbers using the following data structures:
* *red black tree*
* *avl tree*
* *hash table*

The implementation for every data structure can be found under the **src** folder

Source files will be compiled from the **build** folder from the project's root, and all the files
will be linked to a dynamic library and a static library.

For tests the dynamic library will be used
